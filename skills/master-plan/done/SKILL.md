# Task Completion Workflow

Finalize a completed task: verify tests pass, commit changes, update MASTER_PLAN.md, and push.

## Triggers

- `/master-plan:done` - Main command
- "mark done", "task complete", "finish task", "ship it"

## Workflow

### Step 0: Find MASTER_PLAN.md

Resolve the MASTER_PLAN.md path using this priority order:

1. **Env var**: If `MASTER_PLAN_PATH` environment variable is set, use it
2. **Project registry**: Read `~/.dev-maestro/projects.json` — if the current working directory matches (or is a subdirectory of) a registered project's `root`, use its `masterPlan` path
3. **Local .env**: Read `.env` in CWD for a line starting with `MASTER_PLAN_PATH=` and use the value after `=`
4. **Dev Maestro .env**: Read `~/.dev-maestro/.env` for a line starting with `MASTER_PLAN_PATH=` and use the value after `=`
5. **Relative paths** (fallback):
   - `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`
   - `MASTER_PLAN.md`
   - `master-plan.md`
   - `docs/master-plan.md`

For `.env` files, parse lines starting with `MASTER_PLAN_PATH=` and use the value after `=` (strip surrounding quotes if present).
For `projects.json`, parse the JSON and check if any project's `root` is a prefix of the current working directory.

If not found after all steps, tell the user: "No MASTER_PLAN.md found. Run `/task` to create your first task, or set `MASTER_PLAN_PATH` in your environment."

### Step 1: Check What Changed

Run git status to see what files were modified:

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
```

Output immediately:
```
Files changed:
- [list of modified files]
```

### Step 2: Get Task Information

Use `AskUserQuestion` to collect:

1. **Task ID** (header: "Task ID")
   - Options: "Tracked task (enter ID)" or "Quick fix (no task ID)"

2. **Run tests?** (header: "Tests")
   - Options: "Yes — run test suite (Recommended)" or "Skip tests"

Then ask in plain text: "What's a brief summary of the changes? (1-2 sentences)"

**IMPORTANT**: Wait for user to provide the summary before proceeding.

### Step 3: Run Tests (unless skipped)

Detect and run the project's test command. Check in order:
1. If `package.json` exists → `npm test`
2. If `Cargo.toml` exists → `cargo test`
3. If `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` exists → `pytest`
4. If `Makefile` with `test` target → `make test`
5. If `go.mod` exists → `go test ./...`

**If tests fail**: STOP immediately. Report failures. Do NOT proceed.
**If tests pass**: Continue.
**If no test command found**: Warn user and continue.

### Step 4: Update MASTER_PLAN.md (if tracked task)

**Skip this step if user selected "Quick fix (no task ID)".**

**CRITICAL**: Tasks may appear in **multiple locations**. Update ALL of them:

#### 4a. Summary/Roadmap Table

Find the task row and update:

```markdown
# Before:
| **TASK-XXX** | **Title** | **P2** | PLANNED | ... |

# After:
| ~~**TASK-XXX**~~ | ✅ **Title** | **P2** | ✅ DONE (YYYY-MM-DD) | ... |
```

#### 4b. Subtask/Bullet Lists

```markdown
# Before:
- TASK-XXX: Description

# After:
- ~~TASK-XXX~~: ✅ Description
```

#### 4c. Detailed Section Header

```markdown
# Before:
### TASK-XXX: Title (IN PROGRESS)

# After:
### ~~TASK-XXX~~: Title (✅ DONE)
```

#### 4d. Verify All Updated

Search for the task ID and confirm all occurrences show strikethrough or ✅ DONE:

```bash
grep "TASK-XXX" MASTER_PLAN.md  # use the resolved MASTER_PLAN.md path
```

### Step 5: Commit and Push

Stage all relevant files. **NEVER commit**:
- `.env*` files
- `credentials*.json` or files containing secrets
- `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `target/`, `.venv/`
- Backup files, generated stats, lock files (unless intentional)

Prefer staging specific files by name over `git add -A`.

```bash
# Stage code files
git add <changed-files>
git add MASTER_PLAN.md  # if tracked task — use the resolved MASTER_PLAN.md path

# Commit
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(TASK-XXX): Brief summary from user

- Key change 1
- Key change 2

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"

# Push
git push
```

**For quick fixes (no task ID):**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix: Brief summary from user

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
git push
```

**Commit prefix conventions:**
- `feat(TASK-XXX):` — New feature
- `fix(BUG-XXX):` — Bug fix
- `chore(TASK-XXX):` — Maintenance
- `refactor(TASK-XXX):` — Code refactoring
- `docs(TASK-XXX):` — Documentation only

### Step 6: Report Completion

Output this summary:

```
## Task Complete

- **Task**: TASK-XXX (or "Quick fix")
- **Summary**: [user's summary]
- **Tests**: ✅ Passed (or ⏭️ Skipped)
- **Commit**: [short hash] — [message]
- **Push**: ✅ Pushed to origin
- **MASTER_PLAN.md**: Updated / N/A
```

## Important Rules

1. **NEVER skip commit/push** — Changes must be pushed to the remote
2. **ALWAYS collect summary** — Don't proceed without knowing what changed
3. **Update ALL locations** in MASTER_PLAN.md for tracked tasks
4. **Verify with grep** after updating MASTER_PLAN.md
5. **Wait for user input** — Don't assume or skip questions
6. **Test failures block completion** — If tests fail, stop and report

## Files to NEVER Commit

- `.env*` files (secrets)
- `credentials*.json`
- Private keys, tokens
- Generated/cached files (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `__pycache__/`)
- OS files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
